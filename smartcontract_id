/*
This smart contract allows users to verify their identity by calling the verifyIdentity() function. The function requires that the address calling the function is the same as the address being verified. Once an address has verified its identity, the identities mapping is updated to reflect this. The revokeIdentity() function allows the user to revoke their verified identity.

The isIdentityVerified() function can be used to check if an address has a verified identity. When an address verify its identity an event IdentityVerified is emitted with the address that verified its identity as parameter.

It's important to keep in mind that this is just an example of a basic smart contract for managing digital identities and it doesn't include any kind of data validation, encryption, or other security measures. In real-world applications, you would need to implement additional functionality to ensure the security and privacy of users' personal information.

It's also important to note that this smart contract does not provide any way to verify the authenticity of the personal information provided during the verification process. If you need to verify the authenticity of personal information, it is important to use a trusted third-party service to handle this process.
