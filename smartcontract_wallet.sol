/*

This smart contract allows users to deposit and withdraw funds, as well as transfer funds to other users. The contract maintains a mapping of balances for each address, and updates the balance when a user deposits, withdraws, or transfers funds.

The deposit() function allows users to deposit funds into their wallet by sending ether to the contract. The withdraw() function allows users to withdraw funds from their wallet. The transfer() function allows users to transfer funds to other users.

The balanceOf() function allows users to check their current balance in the wallet. When a user transfer funds to other user an event Transfer is emitted, with the from, to and value as parameter.

It's important to keep in mind that this is just an example of a basic smart contract for managing a simple wallet, and it doesn't include any kind of advanced security features, such as multi-sig or rate limiting. It also doesn't include any mechanism to handle any ERC20 or other token, in order to manage other token you should implement the related standard. In real-world applications, you would need to implement additional functionality to ensure the security and integrity of the funds stored in the wallet.
